## Features

<b>Simple, beautiful and modern interface</b>
Loop has a minimalistic interface that is easy to use and follows the material design guidelines.

<b>Habit score</b>
In addition to showing your current streak, Loop has an advanced algorithm for calculating the strength of your habits. Every repetition makes your habit stronger, and every missed day makes it weaker. A few missed days after a long streak, however, will not completely destroy your entire progress.

<b>Detailed graphs and statistics</b>
Clearly see how your habits improved over time with beautiful and detailed graphs. Scroll back to see the complete history of your habits.

<b>Flexible schedules</b>
Supports both daily habits and habits with more complex schedules, such as 3 times every week; one time every other week; or every other day.

<b>Reminders</b>
Create an individual reminder for each habit, at a chosen hour of the day. Easily check, dismiss or snooze your habit directly from the notification, without opening the app.

<b>Optimized for smartwatches</b>
Reminders can be checked, snoozed or dismissed directly from your Android Wear watch.

<b>Completely ad-free and open source</b>
There are absolutely no advertisements, annoying notifications or intrusive permissions in this app, and there will never be. The complete source code is available under the GPLv3.

## Contributing

Loop is an open source project developed entirely by volunteers. If you would like to
contribute to the project, you are very welcome. There are many ways to contribute,
even if you are not a software developer.

* **Report bugs, suggest features.** The easiest way to contribute is to simply
  use the app and let us know if you find any problems or have any suggestions to improve
  it. You can either use the link inside the app, or open an issue at GitHub.

* **Translate the app into your own language.** If you are not a native English speaker, and would
  like to see the app translated into your own language, please join our [open translation project
  at POEditor][poedit].

* **Write some code.** If you are an Android developer, you are very welcome to contribute with code.
  If you already have an idea in mind, you can either implement it and then send a pull request, or open an issue
  first, to discuss your idea before you start your work. If you are out of ideas, have a look at the open issues.
  Tasks that are easier to implement have the green label *small-task*.
  This repository uses the [git-flow branching model][gitflow]. Please, submit pull requests against the
  dev branch. This is the branch that will eventually become the next version of the app.
