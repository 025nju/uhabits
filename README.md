## Features

<b>Simple, beautiful and modern interface</b>
Loop has a minimalistic interface that is easy to use and follows the material design guidelines.

<b>Habit score</b>
In addition to showing your current streak, Loop has an advanced algorithm for calculating the strength of your habits. Every repetition makes your habit stronger, and every missed day makes it weaker. A few missed days after a long streak, however, will not completely destroy your entire progress.

<b>Detailed graphs and statistics</b>
Clearly see how your habits improved over time with beautiful and detailed graphs. Scroll back to see the complete history of your habits.

<b>Flexible schedules</b>
Supports both daily habits and habits with more complex schedules, such as 3 times every week; one time every other week; or every other day.

<b>Reminders</b>
Create an individual reminder for each habit, at a chosen hour of the day. Easily check, dismiss or snooze your habit directly from the notification, without opening the app.

<b>Optimized for smartwatches</b>
Reminders can be checked, snoozed or dismissed directly from your Android Wear watch.

<b>Completely ad-free and open source</b>
There are absolutely no advertisements, annoying notifications or intrusive permissions in this app, and there will never be. The complete source code is available under the GPLv3.
