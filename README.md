# µHabits

µHabits is a simple app for building and tracking habits on Android.

<sub>This software is in alpha stage. Expect occasional bugs and incomplete features.
Suggestions and pull requests are very welcome.</sub>

## Features

* A **simple and beautiful interface**, following material design guidelines.

* Advanced algorithm for calculating the **strength of the habits**. Every repetition
    makes your habit stronger, and every missed day makes it weaker. A single missed
    day after a long streak, however, will not completely destroy your entire progress.
    
* Support for both **daily habits** and habits with more **complex schedules**, such as 3 times
  every week; one time every other week; or every other day.
  
* Habit **reminders**, at a chosen hour of the day.

* **Complete history** of your habit strength and repetitions. Scroll back and see
    how did your habits improved (or not) over time.
  
* **Current streak** and past streaks.
