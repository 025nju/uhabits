# Habits Tracker

Habits Tracker is a simple and beautiful app for tracking the progress of your habits on Android. Features detailed graphs and statistics. It is
completely ad-free and open source.


## Features

* **Simple and beautiful interface**, following the Material Design guidelines.
* **Advanced algorithms for calculating the strength of your habits**. Every repetition makes your habit stronger, and every missed day makes it weaker. A few missed days after a long streak, however, will not completely destroy your entire progress.
* **Detailed graphs and statistics**, showing how did you habits improve over time. Scroll back to see the complete history of your habit.
* Support for both **daily habits** and **habits with more complex schedules**, such as 3 times every week; one time every other week; or every other day.
* **Habit reminders** at a chosen hour of the day.
* **Support for Android Wear**. Reminders can be checked or dismissed from the watch.
* **Completely ad-free and open source**. There are absolutely no advertisements, annoying notifications or intrusive permissions in this app, and there will never be. The complete source code is available under the GPLv3.
