      <h4>How can I track bad habits I want to break?</h4>
      
      <p>It is probably a better idea to rephrase your habit in a positive way. For
      example, instead of having the bad habit &quot;Did you smoke today?&quot; you could have
      the good habit &quot;Did you have a smoke-free day today?&quot;. Another example, instead
      of &quot;Did you eat junk food today?&quot; you could have &quot;Did you eat healthy today?&quot;.
      In this way, every time you open the app to put a checkmark, you are rewarding
      yourself for some good behaviour, instead of getting punished.</p>
      
      <h4>How can I specify that a habit should be performed on certain days of the week?</h4>
      
      <p>You do not need to specify this. The app will figure it out by itself. You just
      need to specify how many times would you like to repeat the habit in a certain
      interval of time. For example, if you want to repeat a certain habit every
      Monday and Friday, simply specify that you want to repeat the habit 2 times in
      7 days, and then keep practicing your habit. If, during your first week, you
      indeed perform your habit on Monday and Friday, the app will automatically add
      a checkmark on the following Saturday and Sunday. As long as you keep your
      routine, the checkmarks should appear automatically on the correct days.</p>
      
      <h4>How can I put checkmarks in past days?</h4>
      
      <p>Open the statistics page for a certain habit, scroll down to the &quot;History&quot;
      section and press the button &quot;Edit&quot; located under the calendar. Then, tap on
      the days to check or uncheck. You can also scroll sideways to change days
      further back in time. This feature has been available since version 1.3.0.</p>
      
      <h4>How can I see the statistics page for a certain habit?</h4>
      
      <p>Just tap on the name of the habit.</p>
      
      <h4>How can I reorder the habits?</h4>
      
      <p>First, press-and-hold the name of a habit for a second. Then, when it becomes
      selected, just drag it to the desired place, without lifting your finger.</p>
      
      <h4>When I am creating a new habit, what am I supposed to write on the &quot;question&quot; field?</h4>
      
      <p>The question field is a place where you can specify more clearly the
      requirements for the habit. For example, while the title of your habit might
      say &quot;Meditate&quot;, the question might ask &quot;Did you meditate for at least 10
      minutes this morning?&quot;. This question appears on the reminders.</p>
      
      <h4>How can I export my data?</h4>
      
      <p>Open the main screen of the app, press-and-hold on the name of a habit, then
      select the option &quot;Export data&quot; from the menu. You can also export data from
      multiple habits simultaneously. The data will be exported as a ZIP archive,
      containing individual comma-separated files for each habit, which can be opened
      with any modern spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice
      Calc.</p>
      
      <h4>If I factory-reset my phone, will I lose all my data?</h4>
      
      <p>Loop supports Android&#39;s native backup service: if you have backups activated in
      your phone settings (Settings / Backup &amp; Restore / Back up my data), it should
      periodically save a copy of your data in the cloud automatically. The data will
      be restored in case you factory-reset your phone or activate a new device. That
      being said, this system can be unreliable at times, so if you want to make sure
      that your data is safely backed up, it is still recommended that you use a
      specialized backup utility, such as Titanium Backup. You can also export your
      data manually, by long-pressing multiple habits, then selecting &quot;export data&quot;
      on the menu. At the moment, there is no way to import the data, but this is a
      planned feature. See the previous question for more details.</p>
