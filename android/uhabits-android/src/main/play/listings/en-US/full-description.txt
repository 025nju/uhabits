Loop helps you create and maintain good habits, allowing you to achieve your long-term goals. Detailed charts and statistics show you how your habits improved over time. The app is completely ad-free, open source and it respects your privacy.

<b>Simple, beautiful and modern interface</b>
Loop has a minimalistic interface that is very easy to use and follows the material design guidelines.

<b>Habit score</b>
In addition to showing your current streak, Loop has an advanced formula for calculating the strength of your habits. Every repetition makes your habit stronger, and every missed day makes it weaker. A few missed days after a long streak, however, will not completely destroy your entire progress, unlike other don't-break-the-chain apps.

<b>Detailed graphs and statistics</b>
Clearly see how your habits improved over time with detailed charts and statistics. Scroll back to see the complete history of your habits.

<b>Flexible schedules</b>
Supports not only daily habits, but also habits with more complex schedules, such as 3 times every week; one time every other week; or every other day.

<b>Reminders</b>
Create an individual reminder for each habit, at a chosen hour of the day. Easily check, dismiss or snooze your habit directly from the notification, without opening the app.

<b>Widgets</b>
Track your habits directly from your home screen, with beautiful and colorful widgets.

<b>Completely ad-free and open source</b>
There are absolutely no advertisements, annoying notifications or intrusive permissions in this app, and there will never be. The complete source code is available under an open-source license (GPLv3).

<b>Works offline and respects your privacy</b>
Loop doesn't require an Internet connection or online account registration. Your confidential habit data never leaves your phone. Neither the developers nor any third-parties have access to it.

<b>Take your data with you</b>
If you want to further analyze your data or move it to another service, Loop allows you to export it to spreadsheets (CSV) or to a database format (SQLite).
